# Matlab-and-C
This is a continuing development of a number and arithmetic operations recogniser and solver in matlab

I'm sorry about how this repo currently looks
I am taking matlab and C in university and we are required to make a project. My project is a matlab application that is capable of taking images and recognising numbers and arithmetic operations in that image. The project fundamentally utilises vectors to iterate through black pixels in the images and if each step of the variable number of vectors for each shape passes - i.e if the pixel is still black - the shape is that which we are searching for.
If you wish to see the most recent code it is within Week-6-half-1. I am working on changing my recognition to work with differently shaped images.
For the time being I am using constant images, but I do hope to be able to get the code to work for variable images.

Thank you for reading and I hope you find this project interesting

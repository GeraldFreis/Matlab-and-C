# Matlab-arithmetic-operations-solver-from-images
This is a continuing development of a number and arithmetic operations recogniser and solver in matlab

For the first half of week -7 I tuned the files such that they would accept two digit identification and arithmetic operations
That's really it.
I also implemented the findingnumbers function which condensed the code and increased time efficiency but other than that implementation alongside
reassignment instead of incrementation for multiple variables that was it

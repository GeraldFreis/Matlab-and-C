# Matlab-arithmetic-operations-solver-from-images
This is just the final version of the code:
-> The other code which includes all of my updates, incremental testing and development over the weeks is stored in:
https://github.com/GeraldFreis/Matlab-arithmetic-operations-solver-from-images/tree/allupdates

# what this code does:
This code takes an image of an arithmetic process (the image must be around 544 x 900 and using 72 calibri font) and can read and interpret the image
to find the numbers and solve the arithmetic operation.
The code then displays that arithmetic operations solution in the command prompt, and shows a graph of the previous solutions to arithmetic operations.

The code currently supports 1 and 2 digit arithmetic operations (i.e each operand is either 1 or 2 digit)

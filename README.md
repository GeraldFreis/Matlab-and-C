# All versions branch of Matlab-arithmetic-operations-solver-from-images

Within this branch is all developments made to produce the final product
The final version folder contains the most recent and hence final product which is capable of taking an image of 544x900 size
that contains an arithmetic operation (like 1 + 2 or 21 x 91) and recognising the numbers from the image and producing the correct output

The product also then outputs the solution and a graph of all previous solutions, read from the pastresults.txt file

The code uses OOP for administration of the code, and asynchronous programming at times, specifically in the FindingOperations, FindingOperationsOneDigit 
and FindingOperationsTwoDigit files.

The code also uses error handling in the findingnumbers.m file.

# NOTE
The images must be centre justified both horizontally and vertically and use size 72 calibri font.

For this update I used constant images number_1.png and plussymbol.png to test my findingones.m and findingplussymbol.m functions.
The expected output for these tests was that each function would return "a one was found" or "a plus was found" given the cleaned matrix input
I again used the main.m file to test the functions by calling the cleaning matrices functions and then the findingones and findingplussymbol functions to
test if a one or a plus was found.

Expected result:
if the image was number_1.png: a one was found\na plus was not found
if the image was plussymbol.png: a one was not found\na plus was found\

// document hiearchy and responsibilities for documents, classes, subclasses, functions 

1. main.m
    responsibilities:
        locate image
        ask user how many digits exist in the image
        call the FindingCharacters class and pass the digits and the image location to the constructor of the class
        take the return information of the getproperties function in FindingCharacters and pass that to the next class
        take the information and pass it to the constructor of the SolvingOperation class
            call the solve_AO_operation function of the class which will print the result of the arithmetic operation

2. FindingCharacters
    responsibilities
        produce matrix of pixels
        call the respective FindingOperationOneDigit or FindingOperationTwoDigit class in a function called findingoperation with the return values of the num_1, operator and num_2
        have a function called getproperties() which returns the properties and their values of the class
    
    properties:
        location of image
        matrix_of_pixels
        number_of_digits
        number_1
        number_2
        operator
    
    memberfunctions / behaviours
        default constructor
            initialises the matrix of pixels to a matrix of zeros(544, 900)
            initialises number_1 to be 1, number_2 to be 1 and operator to be "plus"

        parameterized constructor
            takes location of image, _number_of_digits
            initialises matrix of pixels using the function pixeltomatrix
            initialises number_1 to be 0, number_2 to be 0, and operator to be ""
            initialises number_of_digits to be _number_of_digits

        findingoperation(matrix_of_pixels, number_of_digits)
            checks if digits is 1 or 2 and then depending on which it is initialises
                and calls the classes:
                FindingOperationOneDigit or FindingOperationTwoDigit
                it will call the function in either that is called "returningoperation"
                    returningoperation() will return the properties of FindingOperationTwoDigit or FindingOperationOneDigit which are num_1, operation, num_2
                and it will assign the output to the three variables of this class (number_1, operation, number_2)
        
        getproperties()
            will return the properties, number_1, operator, and number_2

3. SolvingOperations
    responsibilities
        produce the output from the given input
    
    properties
        number_1,
        number_2,
        operation
        result
    
    memberfunctions / behaviours
        default constructor which initialises all to zero
        
        parameterized constructor 
            takes number_1, operation, number_2
            initialises those variables in the property list
        
        solving_AO_operation()
            checks what it must do based upon the operator and returns the result in printed form

FindingOperationOneDigit
    responsibilities
        take the pixel matrix and produce three sub matrices
        iterate over each sub matrix and find the number within it
        return this number in the property list
    
    properties
        first_matrix_of_pixels
        middle_matrix_of_pixels
        final_matrix_of_pixels
        num_1
        operator
        num_2
    
    memberfunctions / behaviours
        default constructor
        parameterized constructor
            takes the original pixel matrix
        
        creatingsubmatrices
            takes the original matrix and produces three sub matrices which is assigned to its respective matrix in the properties of the class
        
        findingfirstnumber
            takes the first_matrix_of_pixels and iterates over every findingnumbers function
            assigns the value found to num_1 in the property list
    
        findingoperator
            takes the middle_matrix_of_pixels and iterates over every findingoperators function
            assigns the value found to operator in the property list as a string. i.e "plus", "minus", "divide", "multiply"
            
        findingfinalnumber
            takes the final_matrix_of_pixels and iterates over every findingnumbers function
            assigns the value found to the num_2 in the property list
        
        returningoperation / getoperation (TBC) 
            takes the num_1, operator, num_2 and returns it

FindingOperationTwoDigit
|| same as one digit except it will produce 5 matrices and will iterate over the first two  and the last two with the findingnumbers functions and the middle with the 
findingoperator functions

To test this weeks changes to the findingnumbers functions I simply changed the images being read to the 1 digit operations images (i.e three_plus_four, nine_divided_by_four etc.). If the number was detected I moved onto the next image that would compare two different numbers and was a 1 digit operation. If the two numbers were not detected, I printed the endpoint of vectors for one or both of the numbers that did not provide the required outcome and then I would use the matrix produced in the FindingOperations class and compare the endpoints to where the endpoints needed to be. Only findingeights and findingnines needed to be changed.

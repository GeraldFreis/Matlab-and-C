# Week-8 1st Update

For this update I produced two scripts savingresults and readingpastresults. The first script takes the current answer to the arithmetic problem in the image and saves it to the pastresultsfile.txt, and the second reads the past results and returns them as an array to the main file so that a plot can be made from the past results. I also produced checkingnumbers directory in src, which calls all of the required findingnumbers functions to determine what numbers or operators exist in each sub matrix.

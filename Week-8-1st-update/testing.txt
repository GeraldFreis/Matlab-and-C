For this week, as the Readme states, I created checkingnumbers functions and the 
savingresults and retrievingpastresults functions. 
The checkingnumbers functions takes the role of iterating through each findingnumbers function
to check if that number exists in the matrix out of the responsibility for the 
FindingOperationsOneDigit and FindingOperationsTwoDigit classes. 
This made my code far more succinct, however, the modular importing may have 
increased runtime very slightly. To test each of the checkingnumbers functions I simply 
integrated them into their respective classes, either FindingOperationsOneDigit 
or FindingOperationsTwoDigit classes in the findingfirstnum, findingoperator and findingsecondnum method of each class.

To test the functions I simply ran the code from the main file with different 
images from the testingimages directory and I ensured that the required numbers 
were found which they were immediately. This was because I copied the code from 
the FindingOperationsOneDigit and FindingOperationsTwoDigit methods and simply 
put them into their own function so no code changes were really required.

For the savingresults and retrievingpastresults functions I tested them by simply 
running the program multiple times with multiple inputs, this increased the database 
of past results and the graph of past results proportionally increased. Some errors I bumped
into were the data not correctly writing to the file, and when it would write it would only
write on one line in a large string. I fixed these errors by printing each current number to
the end of the file with a new line after it. Every test was run through the main file,
as has been the case this entire project, and took different constant images to test

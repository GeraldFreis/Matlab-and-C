For this update I again took pictures, showed those pictures to see if it was deblurred and greyscaled
and then produce a matrix from the pictures. I stored this matrix and then created another cleaned matrix.
this enabled me to look at both of the matrixes in the workspace to ensure that they were as expected.

Expected output from tests:
Deblurred and greyscaled image shown of what the camera took
Deblurred and greyscaled matrix in the workspace
Cleaned matrix of only black and white pixels in the workspace

Tests were conducted through the main.m file which acts as a driver

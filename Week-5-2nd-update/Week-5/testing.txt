like previous weeks I embedded the testing in the main.m file which acts as a driver.

I took the different constant images (which behaved as tests) and passed them into the cleaning matrices functions and then into the findingnumbers 
functions to test if the function recognised the number or symbol in the image. 

expected output:
if image is:
- number_1.png: a one was found, (& none of the other functions return that their number was detected in the image)
- number_2.png: a two was found, (& none of the other functions return that their number was detected in the image)
- number_3.png: a three was found, (& none of the other functions return that their number was detected in the image)
- number_4.png: a four was found, (& none of the other functions return that their number was detected in the image)
- number_5.png: a five was found, (& none of the other functions return that their number was detected in the image)
- number_6.png: a six was found, (& none of the other functions return that their number was detected in the image)
- number_7.png: a seven was found, (& none of the other functions return that their number was detected in the image)
- number_8.png: a eight was found, (& none of the other functions return that their number was detected in the image)
